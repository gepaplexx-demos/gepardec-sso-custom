= Gepardec SSO Custom

This repository represents our custom Keycloak with custom themes and provider implementations.

== Developer Guide

== Keycloak version

The Keycloak version is defined in the file `version` which is used by the github workflows an the Containerfile.

== Local development

Developers need to start a Keycloak Container based on the Keycloak version the sources are meant for for developing.
When started in development mode, the caching for resources is disabled and we can change theme related files
which will be immediately reflected in the GUI after a refresh.
